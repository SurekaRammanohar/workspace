                    In many countries,transportation system had introduce many servies in order to 
                improve the road safety and avoid road traffic.In Europe, they work for the minimum consumption of 
                fuel with safe driving.In 2008 the Japanese  government explore that issue in the incompetence
                of head driver,which may leads to risk of life. There is an existing service such as based on the feedback of the 
                uservehicle but they failed to calculate the trust value of those  vehicles. 

                    They made a detailed study related to this issue,to resolve and make the platoon service to work properly.
                    For this, they need to identify the badly behaved platoon head vehicle.If we failed to identify  the malicious
                    head vehicle this may leads to danger.That is why it is important to identify those attackers in the platoon
                    services.
