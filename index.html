                    In many countries,transportation system had introduce many servies in order to 
                improve the road safety and avoid road traffic.In Europe, they work for the minimum consumption of 
                fuel with safe driving.In 2008 the Japanese  government explore that issue in the incompetence
                of head driver,which may leads to risk of life. There is an existing service such as based on the feedback of the 
                uservehicle but they failed to calculate the trust value of those  vehicles. 

                    They made a detailed study related to this issue,to resolve and make the platoon service to work properly.
                    For this, they need to identify the badly behaved platoon head vehicle.If we failed to identify  the malicious
                    head vehicle this may leads to danger.That is why it is important to identify those attackers in the platoon
                    services.

                In this,our objective is to recommend the well behaved platoon head vehicle to requested vehicle
            Server can maintain the details of those vehicle for calculating their trust values and their reputation values
            From these values, server can differentiate those badly behaved or malicious Platoon head vehicle,and untrusted feedback 
            from the malicious users.There may be chance not having the privacy of feedback data inorder to resolve this server can use 
            some cryptographyic technique to protect those data.Inorder to filter out those malicious vehicle,we should use 
            iterative filtering algorithm and elimitate those vehicles feedback.
